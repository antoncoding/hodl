# ¡Hodl!

Hodling has been the best strategy in crypto. **¡Hodl!** is here to help you do that with some extra incentive!

This is the contract repo for **¡Hodl!**, which enables anyone to create hodling pools.

## What does Hodl do?

When a user deposit into a HODL pool, his fund will be lockup in the contract till the end of a pre-defined **expiry**. If a users want to remove his fund prior to expiry, he will be penalized and the slashed amount will go back in to the **reward pool** that will be shared by everyone else holding the "share".

### Shares and hTokens

Everytime you join the pool, you got a `hodl` Token + a share, the hodl token is a **non-transferable** ERC20, this is to prevent anyone from creating a secondary market to trade this token, which will eventually make this not a hodl strategy anymore. The share you get from deposit will decrease (linear / exponential according to a decrease parameter `n`.) as time goes by, this is to prevent last minute depositor sharing all the rewards.

the creator of the contract can specify a `feeRecipient` address that accured fee from quitters. This can later be set to a governance contract that distribute the reward to all token stakers.

All quitter's penalty go to a common pool, which anyone with the pool share can redeem their proportion anytime.
When a user quit, he / she is also forced to redeemed some pool shares (proportional to the amount they're withdrawing). This is to prevent people from leaving the pool early but still earning rewards.
